Box Design Plan:

11/1/2018
1. Bought box that the system will sit in and eventually be able to unlock it.
2. This box has a latch style system already built in, the plan is to take that part off.
3. Instead of a typical lock and unlock style, I will attempt to let the servo open the lid itself. This is going to happen when a wire is attatched to the inside of the lid and the servo will just push it up.
4. Tonight I will attempt to just atatch the wire and make sure that this will work.
5. Easy back up plan: just have the servo motor unlock and lock a simple lock mechanism that I will purchase as backup if todays plan doesnt work.

adjusted gain to get different microphone power, went up to 8k a little 9k

at 4k to 5k 

an entire turn to reduce the gain by half

v = 0 1
ayye = 2
eee = 0 1

sh= 8

tried changing apmplification factor 
tried changing volume

changing volume did nothing 

put amplification factor into debug and only broke it

reset arduino - did this because it was getting glitchy 

LED test: on is 'eeee', off is 'ssssss'

#include <uspeech.h>
#define led 13
signal voice(A0);
String collvoice;
char prev;
boolean newline=false;
int sum = 0;
void setup(){
  //voice.f_enabled = true;
  voice.minVolume = 200; //1500;
  voice.fconstant = 400;
  voice.econstant = 2;
  voice.aconstant = 4;
  voice.vconstant = 6;
  voice.shconstant = 8;
  voice.calibrate();
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT); 
}

void loop(){
    voice.sample();
    char p = voice.getPhoneme();
    if(p!=' '){
      if(p=='e'){
          newline = true;
      }
      else if(p == 's'){
          newline = false;
      }
    }
    else{
      if(newline){
      digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
      }
      else{
        digitalWrite(led, LOW);
      }
    }
}
