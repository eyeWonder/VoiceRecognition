Box Design Plan:

11/1/2018
1. Bought box that the system will sit in and eventually be able to unlock it.
2. This box has a latch style system already built in, the plan is to take that part off.
3. Instead of a typical lock and unlock style, I will attempt to let the servo open the lid itself. This is going to happen when a wire is attatched to the inside of the lid and the servo will just push it up.
4. Tonight I will attempt to just atatch the wire and make sure that this will work.
5. Easy back up plan: just have the servo motor unlock and lock a simple lock mechanism that I will purchase as backup if todays plan doesnt work.
